How does CoinAwesome create a better, more free web?

Traditional centralized platforms use your data and sell it together with your attention to corporations. You and your data become the product and the network is fully under control of the platform provider, analytics companies and the government. Your identity can get banned and deleted for basically no reason like showing female breasts (e.g. on Facebook) or being part of peaceful activist groups. Not only that you can get excluded anytime but also your data is locked-in into the centralized platform. Most of the time there is no way that you can transfer your identity and reputation to a new platform.

With CoinAwesome all this changes. The users can actually own, operate and even change the network, its rules and style. This is achieved through a Open Source architecture, blockchain-technology, tradable AWE tokens and a decentalized JSON API.
